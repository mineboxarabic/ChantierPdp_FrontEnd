# BDT PDF Text Overlap Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Emoji Characters Causing Formatting Problems**
- ❌ **Removed**: `⚠️` from "Analyse des Risques" title
- ❌ **Removed**: `✅ OUI` and `❌ NON` from table headers → `OUI` and `NON`
- ❌ **Removed**: `🚨` from evacuation icon → `ALERTE`
- ❌ **Removed**: `✓` and `✗` symbols from checkboxes → `O` and `N`

### 2. **Safety Icons Section Overlap**
**Before**: Icons were too wide and overlapping
**After**: 
- Reduced icon container width from 48% to 31%
- Added proper spacing with 3% margins
- Reduced icon size from 36px to 32px
- Added minimum height (80px) for consistent layout
- Improved text size hierarchy (description: 6px, label: 7px)

### 3. **ModernIcon Component Improvements**
```typescript
// Fixed spacing and sizing:
iconContainer: {
    minHeight: 80,        // Prevents overlap
    padding: 6,           // Internal spacing
    marginBottom: 12      // Better separation
}
iconDescription: {
    fontSize: 6,          // Smaller text
    maxWidth: 100,        // Text wrapping limit
    lineHeight: 1.1       // Tighter line spacing
}
```

### 4. **Checkbox and Status Indicators**
**Before**: Large checkboxes with problematic symbols
**After**:
- Reduced checkbox size: 12px → 10px
- Reduced status mini size: 16x12px → 14x10px
- Simplified symbols: `✓✗` → `O N`
- Improved text size: 8px → 7px with better line height

### 5. **Safety Equipment Section**
**Before**: Text potentially overlapping due to tight spacing
**After**:
- Reduced title font size: 10px → 9px
- Added line height control (1.2)
- Better spacing between sections
- Consistent margin handling

### 6. **Overall Layout Improvements**
- **Safety Grid**: Added `alignItems: 'flex-start'` to prevent stretching
- **Interventions**: Reduced padding and improved text sizing
- **Typography**: Consistent font sizing throughout (6-10px range)
- **Spacing**: Better margin and padding control

## Result: Clean, Professional Document Layout
