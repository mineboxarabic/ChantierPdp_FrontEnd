# BDT PDF Modernization Summary

## Overview
Successfully modernized the BDT PDF document with a modern, component-based architecture while maintaining PDF compatibility and professional document appearance.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Component Architecture
- **Created 7 reusable components**:
  - `ModernCard`: Versatile container with headers and accent colors
  - `ModernField`: Label-value pairs with consistent formatting
  - `ModernTable`: Flexible table component with alternating rows
  - `ModernIcon`: Simple icon system using text labels instead of emojis
  - `ModernHeader`: Document header with logo and metadata
  - `RiskItem`: Risk display with visual indicators
  - `ModernSignature`: Professional signature areas

### 2. PDF-Compatible Styling
- **Removed problematic CSS properties**:
  - `borderRadius` reduced from 12px to 4px for PDF compatibility
  - `boxShadow` removed (not supported in PDF)
  - `gap` properties removed from flex layouts
  - Complex gradients simplified to solid colors

- **Layout System Conversion**:
  - Flex layouts with `gap` converted to explicit width percentages
  - Two-column layouts using `width: '48%'` with `marginRight/Left: '2%'`
  - Simplified positioning for better PDF rendering

### 3. Content Improvements
- **Modern Visual Design**:
  - Clean, professional appearance
  - Consistent color scheme (blue, orange, red, green accents)
  - Better typography with clear hierarchy
  - Improved spacing and alignment

- **Enhanced Safety Section**:
  - Added comprehensive EPI (Individual Protection Equipment) section
  - Added EPC (Collective Protection Equipment) section
  - Two-column layout for better organization
  - Clear labeling for required vs. optional equipment

### 4. Text and Icon Improvements
- **Removed emoji characters** that caused formatting issues:
  - Risk icons changed from emojis (üî•, ‚ö°, etc.) to text labels (FEU, ELEC, etc.)
  - Section headers cleaned up (removed üìã, ü¶∫, ‚ö†Ô∏è, etc.)
  - Emergency contact icons changed to text labels

- **Better Text Handling**:
  - Fixed strange character issues (√•, =%, =¬®)
  - Improved placeholder text for missing data
  - Consistent French terminology throughout

### 5. Document Structure
- **Maintained Two-Page Layout**:
  - Page 1: Company info, work details, safety equipment, risk analysis table
  - Page 2: Detailed risks, prevention measures, interventions, signatures

- **Improved Information Hierarchy**:
  - Clear section titles and subtitles
  - Better visual separation between sections
  - Consistent formatting across all components
